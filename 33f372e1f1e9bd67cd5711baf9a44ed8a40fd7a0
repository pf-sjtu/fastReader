Task: webdav-origin-fallback
Summary: Accept X-Request-Origin when Origin header is missing and forward it from client requests.
Files: functions/api/dav/[[path]].js; md_reader/api/dav.js; src/services/webdavService.ts; md_reader/src/services/webdavService.ts
Why: Fix 403 when browser does not send Origin on GET downloads.
